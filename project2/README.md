# About

This project demonstrates the implementation of the mediator pattern to facilitate interaction between QT windows. The program includes four windows, each with specific functionalities:

- Window A: A text editor.
- Window B: Contains copy and paste buttons. The paste button is highlighted if there are copied data.
- Window C: Contains a clear button that clears both the text editor and the clipboard. The button is highlighted if there is content to clear.
- Window D: A text editor containing a list of forbidden words. If a forbidden word is selected in Window A, it is replaced with \*\*\*.

## This project showcases the use of the mediator pattern to manage communication between these windows effectively.
