# About

This project involves using the MVC (Model-View-Controller) framework in Qt to create a model that stores a QMap containing pairs of numbers and strings. The model is displayed in a QListView, showing both the keys and values. Additionally, a delegate is created to allow separate editing of keys and values.

## Main features of the application:

- Model: The model stores a QMap where each entry is a key-value pair consisting of a number (key) and a string (value).
- View: The model is presented in a QListView, displaying both the keys and values of the QMap entries.
- Delegate: A custom delegate is implemented to facilitate separate editing of keys and values within the QListView.

This project demonstrates the use of the MVC pattern in Qt to effectively manage and display data while providing a user-friendly interface for editing the data.
